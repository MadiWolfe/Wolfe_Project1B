	Formed in 2012, The Red Streak strives to ensure that everything from composition, to performance, and recording is done to a higher standard. In the first year after formation, The Red Streak released their first full length album “Knowledge for Nihilists”. Shortly thereafter, “Storm”, the opening track was released as a music video and a passionate fan base was born in the Indianapolis music scene. Afterward, The Red Streak team put their focus into building a recording studio to hone their sound and create an ideal space for composition. The studio, dubbed Clean Break Studios, was built from the ground up and became fully functional in 2015. During the creation of the studio, The Red Streak got the unique opportunity to meet and perform on the same stage as some of their favorite groups including, Intervals, Plini, Chon, and Thank You Scientist. Soon after the building process of the studio was complete, they began recording their first demo at Clean Break. Their demo,“Wherever You Are”, was released in August 2016 and marked the beginning of a year long journey of sound and recording development for the band. On December 25th, 2017 their single, “A Comfortable Silence”, from their upcoming full length album was released alongside a music video, which was filmed at The Palace Theater in Gary, IN. In spring of 2018, The Red Streak will release their full length album, which is loosely based in the themes of the emotional impact of love, loss, and betrayal.
